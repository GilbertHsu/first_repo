# first_repo
repo connect to VSCode
This time I finally fix the git connection problem...
The ssh key is not correct for github, I recreated usingfollowcommand:
> ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "gilbert.hsu@gmail.com" 
without password :D
during the git installation, it use the computer's account to create the key, and it's not match my account in github!
